# Tower Defense Game

Link: https://hanxiangc.github.io/TowerDefense/

This is a traditional tower defense game which proceeds contionously for as long as the player continues to survive.
The player has 10 lives. If more than 10 creeps reach the end of the map, the game is lost.

To start the game, click the start button on the top left corner of the screen.

To build a tower, click one of the options on the right, and place the tower on your desired location with a click.

Game Features:

1. Creeps

There are currently four enemy types:

The Grot

  A tiny and excessively annoying enemy which runs at twice the speed of other enemies. Its tiny size makes it difficult 
  to hit.
  
The Orc

  A regular sized opponent moving at normal speed. Forms the bulk of the horde.
  
The Ogre

  A large enemy with more than twice as much health as the orc.
  
The Golem

  An extremely large enemy with far more HP than any other enemy type. Its enormous size makes it easy to hit. 
  
2. Towers

Towers use an accuracy system which determines graphically and mechanically whether or not a shot hits its target.
A splash damage system is also implemented to ensure that a shot is capable of hitting a target other than its 
intended target.
  
There are currently five types of towers:

The Gun Turret

  A standard rifle. Low cost, average range, good accuracy, and a high caliber bullet.
  
The Shotgun Turret

  A high powered shotgun. It is slow to fire, and has a very short range, however, only the larger enemies can survive
  a full blast from its six buckshot pellets.
  
The Machine Gun Turret

  A fully automatic heavy machine gun. It is highly inaccurate and extremely ineffective against smaller targets, yet its   
  powerful rounds can tear a crowd of creeps to pieces, and larger enemies make for an easier target.
  
The Cannon Turret
 
  Wildly inaccurate and slow firing artillery. A direct hit is enough to destroy most targets instantaneously. It is extremely
  long range, and can hit most targets on the board.
  
The Laser

  Pinpoint accurate, the laser excels at burning down grots. Its weak damage makes it ineffective against other targets 
  without backup from other turrets.
  
The Path

  Enemies spawn from the top left and make their way to the bottom right. Stop them.
  
Good luck!
